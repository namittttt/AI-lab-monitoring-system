# AI Powered Lab Monitoring System (OpenCV)

An AI-powered lab monitoring system that uses **OpenCV** to **count students** from CCTV/video feed, generate **automated reports**, and support **timetable-based automation** for real-world lab management in colleges.

---

## 📌 Project Overview

Managing computer labs manually is difficult in colleges due to:
- High student traffic
- Multiple lab sessions per day
- Lack of proper session-wise monitoring & reporting

This project solves the problem by providing an automated system that can:
✅ detect and count students  
✅ maintain time-based logs  
✅ generate reports for lab sessions  
✅ automate execution using a timetable schedule

## 🚀 Features

- 👥 **Student Counting using OpenCV**
- 🎥 Works with **CCTV / Live camera / Recorded video**
- 🕒 **Time-based logs** (interval/session wise)
- 📄 **Automated report generation**
- 📅 **Timetable Automation**
  - Auto start monitoring during lab hours
  - Auto stop after session ends
  - Generate reports automatically after each session
